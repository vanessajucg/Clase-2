Come on, Harry, we wanna say "good night" to you!
Holding me back
Gravity's holding me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothing to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay
Oh-oh-oh
In this world
It's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world
It's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was
As it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?
Ringing the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well
Oh-oh-oh
In this world
It's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world
It's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was
As it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doing it first
Hey!
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was
As it was
